gradle-jenkins-plugin
=====================

Forked from here : https://github.com/ghale/gradle-jenkins-plugin

Gradle version updated to 4.3.1

I plan to update versions of gradle and dependencies

Gradle plugin to programmatically configure Jenkins jobs.  This plugin allows you to maintain jenkins job configurations in source control and apply them to the server via gradle.  Jobs can be stored as straight xml files, xml strings, markup builder closures, or jenkins job dsl.  Job templates can be defined that can then be manipulated such that multiple jobs can be generated off of a single template definition.

See https://github.com/ghale/gradle-jenkins-plugin/wiki for details on usage.
